# Image_classification using Tensorflow 2 (Keras)

This is a quick introduction to use tensorflow for image classification problem. Here are the steps we perform in this colab notebook:

1) Load train and test data 

2) Preprocess the images

3) Train the model on training data with adam optimizer and categorical_crossentropy loss.

4) Get the model predictions on new test images


# Data

Size of train data: 3000 images.

# Results

Train accuracy 98.7% with 0.0383 loss

Validation accuracy 98.5% with  0.046898 loss
